a# BrainMessenger - Your Digital Asset for Effective Communication

## Introduction: Building a System of Value

Welcome to the BrainMessenger repository. This is not just another messenger. It is a purposeful project aimed at creating a **reliable, scalable, and secure SYSTEM** (Principle 9) that will become a **key digital ASSET** (Principle 10) for every user. Our main goal is to **simplify complexity** (Margulan Seisembayev's principle), providing intuitive and powerful tools for effective communication and interaction in the modern digital world.

BrainMessenger is built upon a **strong foundation** (Principle 8) of deep principles, conscious planning, and **continuous learning** (Principle 1). Every line of code, every decision made – this is a **long-term investment** (Principle 8) in the **quality** (Principle 3) and **value** (Principle 2) of our product.

## Vision and Mission: Our Long-Term View

**Our Vision:** To create a leading digital asset for communication that helps millions of users worldwide effectively exchange information, build communities, and achieve their goals.

**Our Mission:** To simplify complex interaction by providing a reliable, secure, and user-friendly messenger built on principles of quality, transparency, and continuous improvement.

## Key Principles: The Foundation of Our System

Our actions and decisions are guided by a set of key principles that serve as the **foundation** (Principle 8) of the entire BrainMessenger project. These are not just words, but **personal algorithms and standards (Kaizen, Principle 9)**, developed through experience and reflection (Principle 1):

*   **Continuous Learning and Growth (Principle 1):** The process of creating BrainMessenger is a proving ground for deep learning in technology, architecture, and user psychology. We learn at every step, turning mistakes into lessons.
*   **Creating Value (Principle 2):** The user's benefit is at the core of everything. We build something that genuinely solves problems and makes life better.
*   **Quality Over Quantity (Principle 3):** We strive to do things well, not just quickly. Reliability, thoughtfulness, and attention to detail are our priorities.
*   **Mindfulness and Presence (Principle 4):** Being attentive to the process, users, and the team.
*   **Health as a Foundation (Principle 5):** The physical and mental well-being of the team (and future users) is the basis for productivity and sustainability.
*   **Responsibility and Proactivity (Principle 6):** We take responsibility for the outcome and act preemptively.
*   **Integrity (Principle 7):** Our words align with our actions.
*   **Long-term Thinking (Principle 8):** We invest time and effort with a view to the future.
*   **System and Optimization (Principle 9):** We build processes and architecture as a system, constantly seeking ways to increase efficiency (Kaizen).
*   **Creating Wealth > Earning Money (Principle 10):** Focusing on creating an ASSET (BrainMessenger) that brings value and works in the long term.
*   **Flexibility and Adaptability (Principle 11):** Willingness to change tactics and tools while maintaining the vision.
*   **Pragmatism and Realism (Principle 12):** Making decisions based on real data and capabilities.
*   **Persistence (Principle 13):** Not giving up in the face of difficulties, extracting lessons from failures.
*   **Using External Expertise and Feedback (Principle 14):** We learn from others, listen to constructive criticism.
*   **Bias for Action (Principle 15):** In the early stages, it's more important to start doing and get feedback than to plan endlessly.

These principles, inspired by the philosophy of Margulan Seisembayev and the practices of leading IT companies, shape our culture and development approach.

## About the BrainMessenger Project (MVP Focus)

Our current focus is on developing the **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**. The MVP is the first, **pragmatic** (Principle 12) step towards realizing our vision. We are building a **solid technical foundation** (Principle 8) that will allow us to develop the product quickly and efficiently in the future.

The MVP includes basic but **high-quality and reliable** (Principle 3) features that provide key **value** (Principle 2):

*   **Basic Messaging:** Sending and receiving text messages in personal chats and groups/channels.
*   **File Sharing:** Uploading and downloading files (with image optimization).
*   **Channels and Groups:** Basic creation of groups/channels, joining public channels, and reading content.
*   **Basic Account Management:** Registration, login/logout, profile editing (name, avatar), basic security settings.
*   **Core UI Settings:** Choosing the theme (Light/Dark), basic notification and language settings.
*   **Basic Security:** Data encryption (TLS, password hashing, basic measures against SQLi/XSS/DDoS), email confirmation during registration.
*   **Adaptive UI:** An interface adapted for mobile (Android, iOS) and web platforms.
*   **Basic Multilingualism:** Support for several interface languages (English, Russian, and others as per DocLocIn.md).

Functionality beyond the MVP (audio/video calls, advanced security/privacy features, premium subscription, full animation set, AI integrations) is planned for subsequent stages of the Roadmap.

## How We Build: The Story of Creation and the Kaizen Process

The process of creating BrainMessenger is a living story, based on our principles. We build it **systematically** (Principle 9), step by step, documenting each stage and continuously seeking opportunities for **improvement (Kaizen)**.

1.  **Mindful Planning (Principle 4):** The project began with a clear definition of global goals and their decomposition into achievable stages (Roadmap).
2.  **Choosing the Foundation (Principle 8, 12):** We carefully selected the technology stack – reliable and **pragmatic** tools (TypeScript, NestJS, React/RN, PostgreSQL/Neon, Cloudflare R2, Kafka, Redis) that form a **solid technical foundation**.
3.  **Building the MVP Core:** Implementation started with the basic, critical parts of the system (Authentication, Basic UI, Infrastructure, File Handling). We apply **Bias for Action** (Principle 15), focusing on building working components, even if they are minimal for now.
4.  **Continuous Learning and Applying Knowledge (Principle 1):** Every new task, especially related to learning or integrating technologies (as seen in the [Video Tracker](https://www.notion.so/2025-2026-1576e78881b7435e9c3c2cf174e61b91?pvs=4) and tasks), is viewed as an opportunity for growth. We document this process through videos and reflection (Kaizen-Hour).
5.  **Systemic Approach to Quality (Principle 3, 9):** We integrate testing early in the development cycle (Unit tests), configure CI/CD pipelines for automated checks, and use monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry) and logging (Winston, ELK) tools for continuous control over the **system's health** (Principle 5) in real time.
6.  **Documentation as Part of the Knowledge System:** The entire development process, architectural decisions, standards, and requirements are carefully documented. This is not just a formality, but part of creating a **knowledge system** that accelerates onboarding, simplifies support, and enables informed decision-making in the future.

We are building BrainMessenger as a living, evolving organism, constantly adapting and improving based on our principles and feedback from the development process and future users.

## Technology Stack: Our Tools for Creating the Asset

We have chosen a stack that is **pragmatic** (Principle 12), **reliable** (Principle 3), and **scalable** (Principle 8) to create our **digital ASSET**.

*   **Email/2FA:** [Gmail API](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api) - Reliable delivery of transactional emails (Confirmation codes, 2FA).
*   **Payments:** [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), Cryptomus (Beyond MVP) - ASSET monetization, Pragmatism.
*   **Testing:** Jest, Cypress, Detox, k6, OWASP ZAP/Burp Suite (plan) - Comprehensive approach to ensuring quality.
*   **Deployment:** [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) (Web), Docker, [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) - Automated and scalable deployment.
*   **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry (plan) - System visibility and Kaizen analysis.

## Architecture: The Evolution of the System

Currently, BrainMessenger is implemented as a **monolithic application based on NestJS**. This is a **pragmatic** (Principle 12) decision for the MVP, allowing us to quickly launch the product and validate core hypotheses.

In the future, as the project grows and the load increases, we plan a phased transition to a **microservice architecture** using the **Strangler Pattern**. This is a **long-term strategy** (Principle 8) that will enable independent scaling and development of individual components (chats, calls, AI, payments), increasing the system's overall **reliability and flexibility** (Principle 3, 11).

Interaction between components will be via **GraphQL API** (synchronously) and **Kafka** (asynchronously), using **Apollo Federation** (in the future) to build a unified API schema from multiple microservices.

## Project Status: Current Stage (MVP)

At this time, the project is in the active development stage of the **MVP** (as per the [MVP Requirements Instruction](https://www.notion.so/MVP-11a2a21315e54eb3b3c90171b4c7493d?pvs=4)). We are focused on completing the core messaging functionality, file handling, group/channel creation, and basic settings, while simultaneously strengthening the **technical foundation** (Principle 8) and embedding **continuous learning** and **Kaizen** processes into our daily work.

Progress is documented through tasks, code in the repository, and video recordings that showcase our journey and the **process of creation** (Principle 1).
