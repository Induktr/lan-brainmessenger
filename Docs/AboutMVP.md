# About the BrainMessenger Project (MVP Focus)

Our current focus is on developing the **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**. The MVP is the first, **pragmatic** (Principle 12) step towards realizing our vision. We are building a **solid technical foundation** (Principle 8) that will allow us to develop the product quickly and efficiently in the future.

The MVP includes basic but **high-quality and reliable** (Principle 3) features that provide key **value** (Principle 2):

*   **Basic Messaging:** Sending and receiving text messages in personal chats and groups/channels.
*   **File Sharing:** Uploading and downloading files (with image optimization).
*   **Channels and Groups:** Basic creation of groups/channels, joining public channels, and reading content.
*   **Basic Account Management:** Registration, login/logout, profile editing (name, avatar), basic security settings.
*   **Core UI Settings:** Choosing the theme (Light/Dark), basic notification and language settings.
*   **Basic Security:** Data encryption (TLS, password hashing, basic measures against SQLi/XSS/DDoS), email confirmation during registration.
*   **Adaptive UI:** An interface adapted for mobile (Android, iOS) and web platforms.
*   **Basic Multilingualism:** Support for several interface languages (English, Russian, and others as per DocLocIn.md).

Functionality beyond the MVP (audio/video calls, advanced security/privacy features, premium subscription, full animation set, AI integrations) is planned for subsequent stages of the Roadmap.
