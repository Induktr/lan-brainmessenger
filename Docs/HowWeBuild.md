# How We Build: The Story of Creation and the Kaizen Process

The process of creating BrainMessenger is a living story, based on our principles. We build it **systematically** (Principle 9), step by step, documenting each stage and continuously seeking opportunities for **improvement (Kaizen)**.

1.  **Mindful Planning (Principle 4):** The project began with a clear definition of global goals and their decomposition into achievable stages (Roadmap).
2.  **Choosing the Foundation (Principle 8, 12):** We carefully selected the technology stack â€“ reliable and **pragmatic** tools (TypeScript, NestJS, React/RN, PostgreSQL/Neon, Cloudflare R2, Kafka, Redis) that form a **solid technical foundation**.
3.  **Building the MVP Core:** Implementation started with the basic, critical parts of the system (Authentication, Basic UI, Infrastructure, File Handling). We apply **Bias for Action** (Principle 15), focusing on building working components, even if they are minimal for now.
4.  **Continuous Learning and Applying Knowledge (Principle 1):** Every new task, especially related to learning or integrating technologies (as seen in the [Video Tracker](https://www.notion.so/2025-2026-1576e78881b7435e9c3c2cf174e61b91?pvs=4) and tasks), is viewed as an opportunity for growth. We document this process through videos and reflection (Kaizen-Hour).
5.  **Systemic Approach to Quality (Principle 3, 9):** We integrate testing early in the development cycle (Unit tests), configure CI/CD pipelines for automated checks, and use monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, Sentry) and logging (Winston, ELK) tools for continuous control over the **system's health** (Principle 5) in real time.
6.  **Documentation as Part of the Knowledge System:** The entire development process, architectural decisions, standards, and requirements are carefully documented. This is not just a formality, but part of creating a **knowledge system** that accelerates onboarding, simplifies support, and enables informed decision-making in the future.

We are building BrainMessenger as a living, evolving organism, constantly adapting and improving based on our principles and feedback from the development process and future users.
