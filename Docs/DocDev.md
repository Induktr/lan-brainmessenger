# BrainMessenger Landing Page: Development and Deployment Process

## 1. Introduction: Publishing the Gateway to the Asset

**Project Name:** BrainMessenger Landing Page

**Description:** This document outlines the **systematic process** (Principle 9) for developing, building, and deploying the BrainMessenger public website (landing page). The process is designed to be **efficient** and **reliable** (Principle 3), allowing for rapid updates to content and design while ensuring the website is always available as the primary **gateway** to the BrainMessenger **ASSET** (Principle 10).

**Goal:** To provide a clear guide for contributors on how to set up the development environment, make changes to the website, and publish updates using an automated CI/CD pipeline.

**Audience:** Web developers contributing to the BrainMessenger landing page website.

**Principles Applied:**
*   **System and Optimization (Principle 9: Kaizen):** The development and deployment process is structured and automated to maximize efficiency and minimize errors.
*   **Quality Over Quantity (Principle 3):** Ensuring that published updates are tested and reliable.
*   **Pragmatism and Realism (Principle 12):** Using simple, effective tools and processes suitable for a website.
*   **Bias for Action (Principle 15):** Enabling quick iterations and deployment of content and UI updates.
*   **Responsibility (Principle 6):** Defining clear steps and responsibilities within the process.

## 2. Development Process: Building the Presentation

The development process for the landing page follows standard practices for modern web applications built with React/Next.js and TypeScript.

1.  **Get the Code:**
    *   Clone the BrainMessenger repository (if you haven't already). The landing page code is located within a specific folder, likely `packages/web/landing` or similar, or it might be a separate repository depending on how it was set up. *Based on the screenshots, it might be `src/` within a web package, or potentially the root if it's a very simple setup.* Let's assume it's a specific folder within the monorepo or a standalone repo.
    *   Navigate to the landing page project root.
    *   ```bash
        git clone <URL of repository>
        cd <landing page project folder> # e.g., cd packages/web/landing
        ```
2.  **Set up the Environment:**
    *   Ensure you have Node.js and npm/yarn/pnpm installed.
    *   Install project dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install # or yarn install or pnpm install
        ```
    *   Copy the example environment file and fill in any necessary values (likely minimal for the landing page).
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
3.  **Local Development:**
    *   Start the local development server. This command depends on the framework (Next.js or Vite).
        ```bash
        npm run dev # For Next.js or Vite
        ```
    *   Open your browser to the local development URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
4.  **Make Changes:**
    *   Edit content in page components (`src/pages/`).
    *   Update/create UI components (`src/components/`).
    *   Modify styles (`src/styles/`).
    *   Add/update static assets (`public/`).
5.  **Code Standards:**
    *   Adhere to the project's code standards (TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier configuration). Run linters and formatters locally before committing.
        ```bash
        npm run lint
        npm run format
        ```
6.  **Testing (Manual):**
    *   **Manual UI/UX Testing:** Review changes in the browser. Check for correct layout, responsiveness on different screen sizes, and interaction flows.
    *   **Cross-Browser Testing:** Test on supported browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
    *   **Responsiveness Testing:** Check layout on various device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
    *   **Link Testing:** Verify that all outbound links (to the web app, downloads, docs) are working correctly.

## 3. Deployment Process: Publishing Updates (Kaizen in Action)

The deployment process is automated via a **CI/CD pipeline** (likely GitHub Actions, similar to the main app's CI/CD setup). This ensures **reliability** and **efficiency** (Principle 9).

1.  **Commit and Push:**
    *   Commit your changes with clear messages (aligned with Conventional Commits if desired).
    *   Push your changes to the Git repository (e.g., to a feature branch).
2.  **Pull Request (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   If working on a team, create a Pull Request to propose your changes. This allows for code review.
3.  **CI/CD Pipeline (Automated):**
    *   A GitHub Actions (or similar) workflow is triggered by commits or Pull Requests to specific branches (e.g., `main`, `develop`).
    *   The pipeline typically includes:
        *   **Checkout Code:** Get the latest code.
        *   **Setup Environment:** Install Node.js, set up caching.
        *   **Install Dependencies:** Install project dependencies.
        *   **Lint and Format Check:** Run ESLint and Prettier to ensure code standards are met.
        *   **Build:** Build the project for production (`npm run build`). This generates optimized static files or server bundles.
        *   **(Optional) Basic Tests:** Run any basic unit tests if they exist (e.g., for utility functions).
        *   **Deployment:** If the workflow is triggered on the designated deployment branch (e.g., merge to `main`), the built output is automatically deployed to the hosting platform.
4.  **Deployment Platform (Firebase Hosting / Netlify):**
    *   The CI/CD pipeline uses platform-specific tools (e.g., Firebase CLI, Netlify CLI) to upload the built files and publish the new version of the website.
    *   Configuration for deployment is typically stored in files like `firebase.json` (for Firebase Hosting) or `netlify.toml` (for Netlify).
5.  **Verification:**
    *   After deployment, verify the published website in a browser. Check the latest changes, test key links, and ensure responsiveness across devices.
    *   Monitoring tools (if any are set up for the landing page) confirm successful deployment and availability.

## 4. Maintenance: Keeping the Gateway Fresh

Maintaining the landing page involves updating content (news, roadmap, FAQ), fixing UI bugs, and potentially updating dependencies.

*   **Content Updates:** Follow the development process (section 2) to update text, images, or add new sections.
*   **Bug Fixes:** Diagnose issues (e.g., using browser developer tools), make corrections in the code, and deploy using the standard process.
*   **Dependency Updates:** Periodically update project dependencies to get the latest features and security fixes. Use tools like Dependabot (in GitHub) to track updates.

## 5. Notes and Considerations

*   **Simplicity:** The process is designed to be simple and fast, reflecting the nature of a landing page compared to the main application.
*   **Automation:** The focus on CI/CD minimizes manual steps and potential errors during deployment.
*   **Content Management:** For frequent content updates (e.g., blog posts), consider integrating a Headless CMS in the future.
*   **Analytics:** Integrate website analytics (e.g., Google Analytics, Cloudflare Analytics) to track visitor traffic, popular pages, and conversion rates (clicks on download/sign-in links).

This documentation provides a guide for anyone working on the BrainMessenger landing page website, ensuring a consistent and efficient process aligned with the project's overall philosophy.
